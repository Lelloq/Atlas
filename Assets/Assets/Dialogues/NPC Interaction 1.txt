Hey, Congratulations! I Didnt Expect You Back.
Not That I Sent You On An Impossible Task Or Anything.
I Just Thought You Might Not Be Still Breathing When You Returned.
Either Way, you Have Proved Yourself, Maybe You Could Do Me Another Favour.
Ill Get You Out Of This Place If You kill the Goblins On The South-West Road.
