Hey Adventurer! What Is Your Name?
Not Talking Back Huh, Well I Guess That Is Alright.
Anyway, I Need Your Help. My Stupid Brothers Have Stolen All The Ice and Now I Am Going To Melt.
Could You Do Me A Favour and Stop Them From Hoarding It? They Should Be Just North Of Here. 
If You Need There Should Be a Weapon To Help Persuade Them In That House. Return To Me When You Complete The Task!
