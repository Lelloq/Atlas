'Atlas Is A War Torn Land. Since the scorch, all the inhabitants have Evolved and adapted to their new environments.'
'Now, Man Is No Longer At The Top Of The Pecking Order.'
'All sorts of Goblinoid Monstrocities, Slimoid Creatures and mutants are roaming the world.'
'Well, Other Than "The Cain Corporation". They Never lost a dime even through the global holocaust that caused all these mutations.'
'And even now that the world has turned to shit'
'They still tax and fear monger every last one of us pure blood humans that live in the north of cheshire wastes.'
'If You Are Reading this, dont attempt to follow us north, the cain corporation still rules over the north and with no hope of that changing'
'you are better off fighting the monsters than following us into the wolves den, no man or woman has ever left once they enter, the likelyhood is that'
'We Are Already Dead!'
The Book Ends There and is filled with Messy scribbles of the Cain Corp Logo.
